# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using linear regression. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **Step 1: Import Libraries**  
  Load necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

- **Step 2: Load Dataset**  
  Load the housing dataset and inspect its structure.

- **Step 3: Explore Dataset**  
  Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

- **Step 4: Data Cleaning**  
  Handle outliers and clean the dataset for further analysis.

- **Step 5: Feature Engineering**  
  Convert categorical variables into numerical ones.

- **Step 6: Data Visualization**  
  Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

- **Step 7: Model Training**  
  Train a linear regression model to predict house prices.

- **Step 8: Model Evaluation**  
  Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- plotly
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `House Predication.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
